# Main Idea
- In OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) systems (So WiFi), there is a preamble that is sent and contains the Frequency Offset
- This frequency offset refers to the difference in the operating frequencies of two radio oscillators and is needed to interpret signals correctly
- An attacker can jam the preamble which makes the rest of the signal useless and makes communication stop

# Backstory
- The more common type of jammers will jam the whole signal which uses up a lot of energy, can only target a few communications and can be easily detect, localized (find where it is located) and then removed

# The 5 Questions
1. What is the problem or maybe research question? In security, it may translate to: What is the threat?
	- 
2. Is it an important problem? Who cares? (motivation)
	-

3. What is the scenario under consideration? In sec, it often includes: What can the attacker do?
- 

4. What is the proposed attack or mitigation idea/approach?
- 

5. Is the idea really novel, practical, and convincing?	Is there enough evidence to support the claims?
-
