# What is the problem?
Determining the locations of drones is critical to security as they are being used to cause problems both intentional and unintentional but its hard to do that AND keep the privacy. That is where MPC comes in but that can take awhile

# What is the motivation
Keep the privacy especially when there is a drone that is not breaking any rules.

# What is the threat/model?
Hobbiest that are not following the drone rules, terrorists

# What is the solution?
The authors where able to optimize MUSIC to make it significantly faster to compute the DoA estimation. They also proposed a new algorithm SELEST which is even faster.

# Is it novel?
Yes, this is a new algorithm and therefore novel

# Problems
- Limited MPC libraries
- Complex math

# 2 outputs
## Coarse
- No violation in elevation

## Conditioned
- Violates a drone law
