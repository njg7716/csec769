1. What is the problem or maybe research question? In sec, it may translate to: What is the threat?
	- By sniffing Wi-Fi signals, researchers were able to track peoples positions
	-  

2. Is it an important problem? Who cares? (motivation)
	- It is easy and cheap to do

3. What is the scenario under consideration? In sec, it often includes: What can the attacker do?
- You can track a users movements down to a room

4. What is the proposed attack or mitigation idea/approach?
- AP based signal obfuscation
	- AP injects cover traffic into a tranmission
- MAC Randomization
	- low adaptation
- Geofencing
	- limits where the wifi can reach
- Wi-Fi Rate Limiting
	- reduces packet rates to decrease accuracy
- Temporal obfuscation
	- changes transmit power randomly
- Spatial obfuscation
	- Placing a full duplec radio by an anchor
	- no commodity devices on market

5. Is the idea really novel, practical, and convincing?	Is there enough evidence to support the claims?
